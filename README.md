# Nutrition Label

This project is a simple, static webpage that displays a nutrition label. It uses HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and easy-to-read nutrition label.

## Files

The project consists of two main files:

1. `NutritionLabel.html`: This is the main HTML file. It contains the structure of the nutrition label, including the serving size, amount per serving, and daily value of various nutrients.

2. `style.css`: This is the CSS file. It contains the styles for the nutrition label, including the layout, typography, and color scheme.

## Usage

To view the nutrition label, simply open `NutritionLabel.html` in your web browser. The nutrition label will be displayed in the browser window.

## Customization

You can customize the nutrition label by editing the `NutritionLabel.html` and `style.css` files.

In `NutritionLabel.html`, you can change the text of the nutrition facts to display different serving sizes, amounts per serving, and daily values.

In `style.css`, you can change the styles of the nutrition label to create a different look and feel. For example, you can change the font, color scheme, and layout.

## Dependencies

This project uses the [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) font from Google Fonts. The font is linked in the `NutritionLabel.html` file and is loaded from Google's servers when the page is viewed in a web browser.
